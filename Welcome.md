Welcome
Hello there!

We are thrilled to have you on board as you embark on this exciting journey to get your Angular expertise certified. This program is designed to provide you with a comprehensive and structured approach to practicing your Angular skills, as well as help you get familiar with the structure of the official Angular exams.

The program is organized into 9 chapters. The first 8 chapters consist of lessons, pop quizzes, and coding challenges. Each lesson contains a list of resources that are carefully curated to help you understand and master key Angular concepts. At the same time, the pop quizzes and coding challenges provide you with opportunities to test your knowledge and reinforce what you've learned.

We recommend that you start with the first lesson and work your way through the program in sequential order. This will help you build a solid foundation of knowledge and skills you can draw upon as you progress through the program.

We also encourage you to take advantage of the downloadable coding challenges. They are designed to give you hands-on experience with Angular development. These challenges will help you apply what you've learned and develop a deeper understanding of using Angular in real-world scenarios.

Finally, the last chapter of the program consists solely of coding challenges, which will allow you to put your skills to the test and showcase your proficiency as an Angular developer. The format of the Chapter 9 challenges is designed to be very similar to the coding challenges of the final certification exams.

If you face any technical issues or have suggestions for improvements as you go through the preparation material you can let us know by clicking the “Submit Feedback” link at the top of the site.

For technical questions or discussions, you can communicate with the Angular Certified community of developers on Discord (you can accept the invite in your email inbox if you haven't already).

We hope you find this program engaging and rewarding, and we wish you all the best as you become a certified Angular developer!

Sincerely,

The certificates.dev team
