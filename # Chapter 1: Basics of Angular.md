# Chapter 1: Basics of Angular

## Whatâ€™s the difference between Angular JS and Angular?
Angular JS refers to version 1 of the framework, which hasnâ€™t been supported anymore since January 2022.

Angular refers to the modern iteration of the framework, released as Angular 2 in 2016 and now reaching versions 18 and 19 in 2024.

You can find the release history here. -> https://github.com/angular/angular/releases

## The Angular CLI
The Angular CLI is the go-to command line interface to generate, compile, build, and deploy Angular code.

Learn about the main commands and options by reading this section of the official docs:

Command reference -> https://angular.dev/cli
Introduction to the Angular CLI -> https://angular.dev/tools/cli

## Conventions and Style Guide
The official Angular style guide is a mine of information about best practices and how to organize your code in files and folders.

Also, remember that when using the Angular CLI, youâ€™re automatically following the recommended naming conventions for files, classes, and selectors.

You can read it here:

Angular style guide -> https://angular.dev/style-guide

## Features of the framework
Angular is made up of many concepts, features, and APIs. In this section, we want to ensure you know the basic definitions of a component, directive, pipe, and service and that you understand how Angular differs from other technologies.

## Angular Modules and Standalone
Angular modules (or NgModules) can be tricky to understand and are often confusing. In this lesson, letâ€™s learn why Angular modules exist in the first place and whatâ€™s in store for them in the future with the apparition of standalone features, the default mode in new applications built with Angular 17+:

ðŸ’¡ Pro TIP

Modules will most likely get removed from the Angular framework in the future. Modern Angular relies on standalone components instead.
